# MOODS

Five code files:

    main - Before launching the main file, choose the dataset, title, number of runs, and number of steps.
    moods - Before running moods, choose either the data (for Abalone, Shuttle, Spambase, or Connect4) or smallData (for Ecoli, Yeast, or Winequality) file.
    data - For four larger datasets Gisette, Abolone, Spambase, Connect4. "Turn on" lines 306-308, 312-313, and 319-329 if using Gisette dataset. Comment out these lines if NOT using Gisette.
    smallData - For three smaller datasets Ecoli, Yeast, Winequality
    model - MOODS's convoluted neural network model; developed to match that of state-of-the-art methods SMOTified-GAN, GBO, SSG, and MUBO.
